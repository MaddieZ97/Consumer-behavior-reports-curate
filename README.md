# Consumer-behavior-reports-curate
I'm trying to paraphrase/summarize all the consumer behavior reports I've read. Original article links are included as reference. 
This is for: 
- showcasing what I've learned about the latest market trend 
- storing historical good reports on consumer behaviors 
- offering summaries on what these long reports covered
